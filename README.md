# Generated class for Collection classes is not deterministic

This is a repro for an issue where the generated bytecode of classes implementing the `Collection` interface is indeterministic.

Just run this command line to repro:

```
./gradlew :compileKotlin
javap build/classes/kotlin/main/com/twitter/test/MyCollection.class > MyCollection1.txt
rm -rf build
./gradlew :compileKotlin
javap build/classes/kotlin/main/com/twitter/test/MyCollection.class > MyCollection2.txt
diff  MyCollection1.txt  MyCollection2.txt
```
